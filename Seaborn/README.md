# Seaborn Library
In this section, different python codes using the Seaborn module and written in various IDE's such as PyCharm, SublimeText and JupyterNotebook are presented. The Seaborn library provides more options with a greater number of plot types compared to Matplotlib.
<br>I hope the example codes help you improve your Python skills.
